# Evaluation of Experiments performed at Bessy-II Synchrotron at Beamline KMC-II 
Data analysis of $\text{in situ}^2$ experiments at the KMC-II beamline at Bessy II Synchrotron.
Allows to:

* Evaluate $\text{in situ}^2$ straining experiments to correlate the stress measured via $\text{in situ}^2$ with the strain from an Anton Paar tensile stage (https://www.anton-paar.com/ph-en/products/details/tensile-stage-ts-600/) with the electrical data measured via a Keythley.

* Evaluate $\text{in situ}^2$ heating experiments to correlate the stress measured via $\text{in situ}^2$ with the temperature from an Anton Paar heating stage ([https://www.anton-paar.com/ph-en/products/details/tensile-stage-ts-600/](https://www.anton-paar.com/corp-en/products/details/domed-hot-stage-for-four-circle-goniometers-dhs-1100/)https://www.anton-paar.com/corp-en/products/details/domed-hot-stage-for-four-circle-goniometers-dhs-1100/).
